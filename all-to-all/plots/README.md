# All-to-All Plots
The Python script `plot.py` generates bandwidth plots from benchmark output. See the machine directories for output files. The original output files from batch scripts were edited to split them into separate data files for each contiguous-communicator run and each strided-communicator run.  
The last few lines of `plot.py` show the function calls for the output PDFs.
