# Build Documentation

## LAMMPS Version
This benchmark was constructed using the LAMMPS commit 08498637aa, which is based on the February 7, 2024 version of LAMMPS with bug fixes and performance improvements.
See https://docs.lammps.org/Build_make.html for more information about building LAMMPS with the Make-based build system.

## Required Packages
The supplied LAMMPS benchmarks require the following packages:
- KSPACE -- for PPPM long-range solver
- MOLECULE -- for ``atom_style full``
- REAXFF -- for ReaxFF potential
- RIGID -- for ``fix shake``

And additional packages for acceleration:
- KOKKOS -- for CPU (OpenMP) and GPU acceleration
or
- OPENMP -- for CPU-based acceleration

## Software Prerequisites
- A C++14 capable compiler
- GNU make
- Optional: hwloc
- Optional: LAMMPS-supported FFT library for KSPACE (ie, FFTW3, cuFFT)

## How to Build:
There are 2 build scripts provided:
- build_lammps_cpu.sh -- builds an OpenMP-accelerated binary of LAMMPS using FFTW3 for FFTs.
- build_lammps_gpu.sh -- builds a GPU-accelerated binary of LAMMPS using Kokkos with CUDA backend, using cuFFT for FFTs.

### build_lammps_cpu.sh
This script sets up the environment used on the Summit POWER9 supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for CPU-only runs.
The Makefile, which is located in ``makefiles/Makefile.summit_cpu``, uses the GNU ``g++`` compiler & linker.
The build script copies this script into ``lammps/src/MAKE/MINE/Makefile.summit_cpu``, where it is found by the LAMMPS build system.
To use the internal LAMMPS KISS-FFT instead of FFTW3, remove the define, include, and link lines in the ``Makefile.summit_cpu``.

### build_lammps_gpu.sh
This script sets up the environment used on the Summit POWER9 supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), with NVIDIA V100 support.
The Makefile, which is located in ``makefiles/Makefile.summit_gpu``, uses the Kokkos ``nvcc_wrapper`` for compilation and linking.
The build script copies this script into ``lammps/src/MAKE/MINE/Makefile.summit_gpu``, where it is found by the LAMMPS build system.
To use the internal LAMMPS KISS-FFT instead of cuFFT, remove the define, include, and link lines in the ``Makefile.summit_gpu``.
Kokkos is compiled with CUDA support.
