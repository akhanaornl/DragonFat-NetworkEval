# Build Documentation

## LAMMPS Version
This benchmark was constructed using the LAMMPS commit 08498637aa, which closely follows the 7 February 2024 version of LAMMPS, with minor bug fixes and performance improvements for the SPC/e system.
See https://docs.lammps.org/Build_make.html for more information about building LAMMPS with the Make-based build system.

## Required Packages
The supplied LAMMPS benchmarks require the following packages:
- KSPACE -- for PPPM long-range solver
- MOLECULE -- for ``atom_style full``
- REAXFF -- for ReaxFF potential
- RIGID -- for ``fix shake``

And additional packages for acceleration:
- KOKKOS -- for CPU (OpenMP) and GPU acceleration
or
- OPENMP -- for CPU-based acceleration

## Software Prerequisites
- A C++14 capable compiler
- GNU make
- Optional: hwloc
- Optional: LAMMPS-supported FFT library for KSPACE (ie, FFTW3, hipFFT)

## How to Build:
There are 2 build scripts provided:
- build_lammps_cpu.sh -- builds an OpenMP-accelerated binary of LAMMPS using FFTW3 for FFTs.
- build_lammps_gpu.sh -- builds a GPU-accelerated binary of LAMMPS using Kokkos with HIP backend, using hipFFT for FFTs.

### build_lammps_cpu.sh
This script sets up the environment used on the Frontier HPE Cray EX supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for CPU-only runs.
The Makefile, which is located in ``makefiles/Makefile.frontier_cpu``, uses the AMD ``amdclang++`` compiler & linker.
The build script copies this script into ``lammps/src/MAKE/MINE/Makefile.frontier_cpu``, where it is found by the LAMMPS build system.
To use the internal LAMMPS KISS-FFT instead of FFTW3, remove the define, include, and link lines in the ``Makefile.frontier_cpu``.

### build_lammps_gpu.sh
This script sets up the environment used on the Frontier HPE Cray EX supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), with AMD Instinct MI250X support.
The Makefile, which is located in ``makefiles/Makefile.frontier_gpu``, uses the AMD ``hipcc`` wrapper for compilation and linking.
The build script copies this script into ``lammps/src/MAKE/MINE/Makefile.frontier_gpu``, where it is found by the LAMMPS build system.
To use the internal LAMMPS KISS-FFT instead of hipFFT, remove the define, include, and link lines in the ``Makefile.frontier_gpu``.
Kokkos is compiled with HIP support.
